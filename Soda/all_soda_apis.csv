CIM_2017,"This layer represents the OIT Community Anchor Institutions (CAI) data set. ''Community Anchor Institutions'' consist of schools, libraries, medical and healthcare providers, public safety entities, community colleges and other institutions of higher education, and other community support organizations and entities. These locations may not offer broadband availability to the public (although most libraries and many schools, and community centers do) but offer an opportunity for policy makers to understand where community anchor institutions which have broadband access are located; this can help in identifying challenges and opportunities to reaching connectivity goals. Although it is constantly being improved upon, ultimately we aim for this data set to evolve into a reliable resource for emergency response services.

For reservoirs created by excavation, or where the invert of the outlet conduit is placed below the surface of the natural ground at its lowest point beneath the dam, the jurisdictional height shall be measured from the invert of the outlet at the longitudinal centerline of the embankment or from the bottom of the excavation at the longitudinal centerline of the dam, whichever is greatest.

DWR Livestock Water Tank and Erosion Control Dams,"Livestock water tanks are covered under the ""Livestock Water Tank Act of Colorado"" sections 35-49-101 to 35-49-116, C.R.S.

Again, as with erosion control dams, the height is measured from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the spillway. No livestock water tanks can be used for irrigation purposes.
Erosion control dams are governed under Colorado statute (see section 37-87-122, C.R.S. (1990). These types of structures may be constructed on water courses which have been determined by the state engineer to be normally dry (which for our purposes is dry more than 80% of the time). Structures of this type cannot exceed fifteen feet from the bottom of the channel to the bottom of the spillway and cannot exceed ten acre-feet at the emergency spillway level. The height of the dam is measured vertically from the lowest point of the upstream toe to the crest of the dam in contrast to those measured vertically from the centerline pursuant to section 37-87-105, C.R.S. (1990). Note: The structure can be larger than specified under section 37-87-122, however, it then will be evaluated and must be constructed pursuant to section 37-87-105.","['livestock water tank erosion control', 'dam safety', 'reservoir']",https://data.colorado.gov/resource/r2rp-ecjb.json,,Division of Water Resources

ColoradoCAI,"This layer represents the OIT Community Anchor Institutions (CAI) data set. ''Community Anchor Institutions'' consist of schools, libraries, medical and healthcare providers, public safety entities, community colleges and other institutions of higher education, and other community support organizations and entities. These locations may not offer broadband availability to the public (although most libraries and many schools, and community centers do) but offer an opportunity for policy makers to understand where community anchor institutions which have broadband access are located; this can help in identifying challenges and opportunities to reaching connectivity goals. Although it is constantly being improved upon, ultimately we aim for this data set to evolve into a reliable resource for emergency response services.

Web Map Services - Please note that the endpoint below also offers links for JSON, SOAP, WMS, and WFS. Additionally, the ""Google Earth"" link allows the user to download a KMZ file representative of the CAI data set.
