Perimeters are the line surrounding land that has been impacted by a wildfire. Consumption Best Practices:

As a service that is subject to very high usage, ensure 
peak performance and accessibility of your maps and apps by avoiding the
use of non-cacheable relative Date/Time field filters. To accommodate 
filtering events by Date/Time, we suggest using the included ""Age"" 
fields that maintain the number of days or hours since a record was 
created or last modified, compared to the last service update. These 
queries fully support the ability to cache a response, allowing common 
query results to be efficiently provided to users in a high demand 
service environment. When ingesting this service in your applications, avoid using POST
requests whenever possible. These requests can compromise performance 
and scalability during periods of high usage because they too are not 
cacheable. Source: Wildfire points are sourced from Integrated Reporting of Wildland-Fire Information (IRWIN) and perimeters from National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). Current Incidents: This layer provides a near real-time view of the data being shared through the Integrated Reporting of Wildland-Fire Information (IRWIN) service. IRWIN provides data exchange capabilities between participating wildfire systems, including federal, state and local agencies. Data is synchronized across participating organizations to make sure the most current information is available. The display of the points are based on the NWCG Fire Size Classification applied to the daily acres attribute. Current Perimeters: This layer displays fire perimeters posted to the National Incident Feature Service. It is updated from operational data and may not reflect current conditions on the ground. For a better understanding of the workflows involved in mapping and sharing fire perimeter data, see the National Wildfire Coordinating Group Standards for Geospatial Operations. Update Frequency: Every 15 minutes using the Aggregated Live Feed Methodology based on the following filters: Events modified in the last 7 days Events that are not given a Fire Out Date Incident Type Kind: Fires Incident Type Category: Prescribed Fire, Wildfire, and Incident Complex

Area Covered: United States What can I do with this layer? The data includes basic wildfire information, such as location, size, environmental conditions, and resource summaries. Features can be filtered by incident name, size, or date keeping in mind that not all perimeters are fully attributed. Attribute Information This is a list of attributes that benefit from additional explanation. Not all attributes are listed. Incident Type Category: This is a breakdown of events into more specific categories. Wildfire (WF) -A wildland fire originating from an unplanned ignition, such as lightning, volcanos, unauthorized and accidental human caused fires, and prescribed fires that are declared wildfires. Prescribed Fire (RX) - A wildland fire originating from a planned ignition in accordance with applicable laws, policies, and regulations to meet specific objectives. Incident Complex (CX) - An incident complex is two or more individual incidents in the same general proximity that are managed together under one Incident Management Team. This allows resources to be used across the complex rather than on individual incidents uniting operational activities. IrwinID: Unique identifier assigned to each incident record in both point and perimeter layers.

Acres: these typically refer to the number of acres within the current perimeter of a specific, individual incident, including unburned and unburnable islands. Discovery: An estimate of acres burning upon the discovery of the fire. Calculated or GIS:  A measure of acres calculated (i.e., infrared) from a geospatial perimeter of a fire. Daily: A measure of acres reported for a fire. Final: The measure of acres within the final perimeter of a fire. More specifically, the number of acres within the final fire perimeter of a specific, individual incident, including unburned and unburnable islands.

Dates: the various systems contribute date information differently so not all fields will be populated for every fire. FireDiscovery: The date and time a fire was reported as discovered or confirmed to exist. May also be the start date for reporting purposes.

Containment: The date and time a wildfire was declared contained. Control: The date and time a wildfire was declared under control. ICS209Report: The date and time of the latest approved ICS-209 report. Current: The date and time a perimeter is last known to be updated. FireOut: The date and time when a fire is declared out. ModifiedOnAge: (Integer) Computed days since event last modified. DiscoveryAge: (Integer) Computed days since event's fire discovery date. CurrentDateAge: (Integer) Computed days since perimeter last modified. CreateDateAge: (Integer) Computed days since perimeter entry created.

GACC: A code that identifies one of the wildland fire geographic area coordination centers. A geographic area coordination center is a facility that is used for the coordination of agency or jurisdictional resources in support of one or more incidents within a geographic coordination area. Fire Mgmt Complexity: The highest management level utilized to manage a wildland fire event. Incident Management Organization: The incident management organization for the incident, which may be a Type 1, 2, or 3 Incident Management Team (IMT), a Unified Command, a Unified Command with an IMT, National Incident Management Organization (NIMO), etc. This field is null if no team is assigned. Unique Fire Identifier: Unique identifier assigned to each wildland fire. yyyy = calendar year, SSUUUU = Point Of Origin (POO) protecting unit identifier (5 or 6 characters), xxxxxx = local incident identifier (6 to 10 characters) Revisions Jan 4, 2021: Added Integer fields 'Days Since...' to Current_Incidents point layer and  Current_Perimeters polygon layer. These fields are computed when the data is updated, reflecting the current number of days since each record was last updated. This will aid in making 'age' related, cache friendly queries. Mar 12, 2021: Added second set of 'Age' fields for Event and Perimeter record creation, reflecting age in Days since service data update. Apr 21, 2021: Current_Perimeters polygon layer is now being populated by NIFC's newest data source. A new field was added, 'IncidentTypeCategory' to better distinguish Incident types for Perimeters and now includes type 'CX' or Complex Fires. Five fields were not transferrable, and as a result 'Comments', 'Label', 'ComplexName', 'ComplexID', and 'IMTName' fields will be Null moving forward. Apr 26, 2021: Updated Incident Layer Symbology to better clarify events, reduce download size and overhead of symbols. Updated Perimeter Layer Symbology to better distingish between Wildfires and Prescribed Fires. May 5, 2021: Slight modification to Arcade logic for Symbology, refining Age comparison to Zero for fires in past 24-hours. Aug 16, 2021: Enabled Time Series capability on Layers (off by default) using 'Fire Discovery Date' for Incidents and 'Creation Date' for Perimeters.

This data is developed from crash data records compiled by CDOT from police accident reports filed with the state by each jurisdiction in the region. CDOT consolidates the police reports into a single database, removes personal identifying information, and then provides PPACG with an exported table of crash data records. The majority of the crash records (greater than 99.99%) are successfully linear referenced to routes or geocoded to address information acquired from CDOT, the El Paso-Teller County E911 Authority, and Park County. All crash records associated with roadways modeled in PPACG's Route Centerlines feature class are further refined by PPACG to align with coincident roadway network links and intersections. The 'Crash_ID' field stores the unique ID value for each feature in this data set, and is derived as a concatenation of the crash year and the 'CUID' CDOT crash database identifier field. The 'CUID' field is provided by CDOT in their crash data deliverable, and may not be unique. The 'RouteCL_ID' field, the ‘NetLink_ID' field, and the 'Intrsct_ID' fields record the foreign keys for any related features in PPACG's respective Route Centerlines, Roadway Network Links, and Roadway Network Intersections feature classes. The ‘Severity’ field categorizes each crash according to the severity of injuries or resultant fatalities, if any, as reported in the crash data. The 'Date_Time' field stores the concatenated crash date and crash time from each report into a single date field, while the 'Day' field records the day of the week of each crash. The 'DriveImp_1', 'DriveImp_2', and 'NM_Imp' fields identify if the drivers or non-motorist involved in each crash was suspected of drug or alcohol impairment according to the crash record, which may have included field sobriety testing. Those fields are not updated with the results of any further tests or other conclusive measures that may have been performed after the crash report was filed. All remaining fields are derived directly from CDOT crash data records, altered by PPACG to provide descriptive and consistent field names and aliases that still logically reference the original CDOT crash data schema, and primarily describe the location, roadway features, conditions, vehicle information, and driver actions documented with each crash record.","Crash,Traffic,Safety","The Traffic Crashes feature layer is a point model of roadway traffic crashes within the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments (PPACG) region, and was primarily developed to help with regional safety planning and mapping projects related to these features.","/Categories/Transportation/Performance and Utilization,/Categories/Health and Safety","CDOT, DiExSys, El Paso-Teller 911 Authority","This data, information, or mapping product (""product"") is made available by the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments (PPACG) as a public service.

Government regulators such as the United States Federal Communications Commission and the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission use Speedtest data to hold telecommunications entities accountable and direct funds for rural and urban connectivity development. Ookla licenses data to NGOs and educational institutions to fulfill its mission: to help make the internet better, faster and more accessible for everyone. Ookla hopes to further this mission by distributing the data to make it easier for individuals and organizations to use it for the purposes of bridging the social and economic gaps between those with and without modern Internet access. Data Overview Tiles Hundreds of millions of Speedtests are taken on the Ookla platform each month. In order to create a manageable dataset, we aggregate raw data into tiles. The size of a data tile is defined as a function of ""zoom level"" (or ""z""). At z=0, the size of a tile is the size of the whole world. At z=1, the tile is split in half vertically and horizontally, creating 4 tiles that cover the globe. This tile-splitting continues as zoom level increases, causing tiles to become exponentially smaller as we zoom into a given region. By this definition, tile sizes are actually some fraction of the width/height of Earth according to Web Mercator projection (EPSG:3857). As such, tile size varies slightly depending on latitude, but tile sizes can be estimated in meters. For the purposes of these layers, a zoom level of 16 (z=16) is used for the tiling. This equates to a tile that is approximately 610.8 meters by 610.8 meters at the equator (18 arcsecond blocks). The geometry of each tile is represented in WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) in the tile field. The data can be found at: https://github.com/teamookla/ookla-open-data Update Cadence The tile aggregates start in Q1 2019 and go through the most recent quarter. They will be updated shortly after the conclusion of the quarter. Esri Processing This layer is a best available aggregation of the original Ookla dataset. This means that for each tile that data is available, the most recent data is used. So for instance, if data is available for a tile for Q2 2019 and for Q4 2020, the Q4 2020 data is awarded to the tile. The default visualization for the layer is the ""broadband index"". The broadband index is a bivariate index based on both the average download speed and the average upload speed. For Mobile, the score is indexed to a standard of 35 megabits per second (Mbps) download and 3 Mbps upload. A tile with average Speedtest results of 25/3 Mbps is awarded 100 points. Tiles with average speeds above 25/3 are shown in green, tiles with average speeds below this are shown in fuchsia. For Fixed, the score is indexed to a standard of 100 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload. A tile with average Speedtest results of 100/20 Mbps is awarded 100 points. Tiles with average speeds above 100/20 are shown in green, tiles with average speeds below this are shown in fuchsia. Tile Attributes Each tile contains the following attributes: The year and the quarter that the tests were performed. The average download speed of all tests performed in the tile, represented in megabits per second. The average upload speed of all tests performed in the tile, represented in megabits per second. The average latency of all tests performed in the tile, represented in milliseconds The number of tests taken in the tile. The number of unique devices contributing tests in the tile. The quadkey representing the tile. Quadkeys Quadkeys can act as a unique identifier for the tile. This can be useful for joining data spatially from multiple periods (quarters), creating coarser spatial aggregations without using geospatial functions, spatial indexing, partitioning, and an alternative for storing and deriving the tile geometry. Layers There are two layers: Ookla_Mobile_Tiles - Tiles containing tests taken from mobile devices with GPS-quality location and a cellular connection type (e.g. 4G LTE, 5G NR). Ookla_Fixed_Tiles - Tiles containing tests taken from mobile devices with GPS-quality location and a non-cellular connection type (e.g. WiFi, ethernet). The layers are set to draw at scales 1:3,000,000 and larger. Time Period and Update Frequency Layers are generated based on a quarter year of data (three months) and files will be updated and added on a quarterly basis. A year=2020/quarter=1, the first quarter of the year 2020, would include all data generated on or after 2020-01-01 and before 2020-04-01. Data is subject to be reaggregated regularly in order to honor Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR) as is applicable in certain jurisdictions under laws including but not limited to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD). Therefore, data accessed at different times may result in variation in the total number of tests, tiles, and resulting performance metrics.","Ookla,Speedtest,Global,Fixed,Mobile,Network Performance,Broadband,Policy,Infrastructure,Telecommunications,Telecom","This dataset provides global fixed broadband and mobile (cellular) network performance metrics in zoom level 16 web mercator tiles (approximately 610.8 meters by 610.8 meters at the equator).

Peak Rural Transportation Authority (PPRTA), Pikes Peak Transportation 
Improvement Program (TIP), or the CDOT 10-Year Plans within the Pikes 
Peak Area Council of Governments (PPACG) region. As the 
federally-designated Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) 
for the Colorado Springs area, the Pikes Peak Area Council of 
Governments (PPACG) is responsible for developing and maintaining a 
regional Long-Range Transportation Plan (LRTP) in order to be eligible 
for 
federal funding of transportation projects within the MPO area. All 
transportation projects that could 
significantly alter transportation or air quality within the 
metropolitan planning area must be included in the plan. The 
Transportation 
Improvement Program (TIP) implements the LRTP's goals by identifying 
specific transportation and transit projects to receive funding as it 
becomes available. The Colorado Department of 
Transportation (CDOT) 10-Year plans identify and prioritize CDOT's 
transportation and transit projects pertaining to state-managed 
Interstates and highways over a ten year period for each of the state's 
Transportation Planning Regions (TPR). The PPACG area includes CDOT 
projects within the Pikes Peak Area MPO (TPR 1) and the Central Front 
Range planning region (TPR 14). The Pikes 
Peak Rural Transportation Authority (PPRTA) is a collaborative effort 
among local governments to fund a variety of voter-approved 
transportation infrastructure capital projects, transit and multimodal 
improvements, and operational maintenance activities. These projects are
also identified within the LRTP. The map contains the point 
and polyline layers of these regional projects, a 
layer of Route Centerlines which identify the functionally classified 
roadways eligible for federal funding, the MPO boundary, the PPACG boundary, and the PPRTA boundary. For more detailed information regarding the information contained,

The Intercity Bus Atlas (ICBA) initiative collects, compiles, maps, publishes, and archives scheduled intercity bus service data provided by North American bus service providers. ICBA data--collected as periodic historic snapshots of available intercity bus services--is intended for federal, state, local, and tribal transportation decision makers, metropolitan planning organizations, transportation-related associations, private sector actors (including the freight community), and the public to better understand the density, frequency, accessibility, and reachability provided by the intercity bus industry's services. The stop, route, and schedule data provided by the ICBA reveal the local, interregional, and international connectivity, service densities, frequencies, and travel patterns enabled by the intercity bus component of the United States' myriad transportation facilities and services as well as how these services co-exist with other modes of passenger travel. The underlying source data of the ICBA are supplied by participating North American bus service providers, who publish their schedule information compliant the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS). This GTFS standard allows intercity bus providers to publish operational information on their stops, routes, trips, schedules, fares, and transfers in a way that is maximally interoperable with applications that consume, process, and visualize the data for riders and others interested in learning more about their services. The ICBA, however, relies only on data provided via GTFS' schedule component; while there is a second GTFS component for real-time bus location data, it is not currently utilized or required for the ICBA. More information on GTFS is available at https://gtfs.org/schedule/. In turn, the Bureau of Transportations Statistics collects GTFS schedule data from provider websites and compiles them into a single geospatially enabled database. As of December 2023, this database contains two feature layers, each representing a different component of providers networks: stops and routes.

The National Risk Index is a dataset and online tool that helps to illustrate the communities most at risk for 18 natural hazards across the United States and territories: Avalanche, Coastal Flooding, Cold Wave, Drought, Earthquake, Hail, Heat Wave, Hurricane, Ice Storm, Landslide, Lightning, Riverine Flooding, Strong Wind, Tornado, Tsunami, Volcanic Activity, Wildfire, and Winter Weather. The National Risk Index provides Risk Index values, scores and ratings based on data for Expected Annual Loss due to natural hazards, Social Vulnerability, and Community Resilience. Separate values, scores and ratings are also provided for Expected Annual Loss, Social Vulnerability, and Community Resilience. For the Risk Index and Expected Annual Loss, values, scores and ratings can be viewed as a composite score for all hazards or individually for each of the 18 hazard types.

This tool was created for broad nationwide comparisons and is not a substitute for localized risk assessment analysis. Nationwide datasets used as inputs for the National Risk Index are, in many cases, not as accurate as available local data. Users with access to local data for each National Risk Index risk factor should consider substituting the Risk Index data with local data to recalculate a more accurate risk index. If you decide to download the National Risk Index data and substitute it with local data, you assume responsibility for the accuracy of the data and any resulting data index. The methodology used by the National Risk Index has been reviewed by subject matter experts in the fields of natural hazard risk research, risk analysis, mitigation planning, and emergency management. The processing methods used to create the National Risk Index have produced results similar to those from other natural hazard risk analyses conducted on a smaller scale. The breadth and combination of geographic information systems (GIS) and data processing techniques leveraged by the National Risk Index enable it to incorporate multiple hazard types and risk factors, manage its nationwide scope, and capture what might have been missed using other methods. The National Risk Index does not consider the intricate economic and physical interdependencies that exist across geographic regions. Keep in mind that hazard impacts in surrounding counties or Census tracts can cause indirect losses in your community regardless of your community's risk profile. Nationwide data available for some risk factors are rudimentary at this time. The National Risk Index will be continuously updated as new data become available and improved methodologies are identified.

The tool pulls together 35 indicators to calculate a score identifying which communities face higher environmental, health, and socioeconomic burdens. By examining how these factors combine, the tool shows how communities are affected by multiple stressors simultaneously. Community voices and expertise were vital to making Colorado EnviroScreen useful to communities disproportionately impacted by environmental health burdens. For the development of the first version of the tool, we engaged more than 200 people. Colorado EnviroScreen 2.0 development involved review teams from Colorado State University and the Colorado School of Public Health, along with feedback from hundreds of Coloradans. In November 2024, the Office of Environmental Justice released a second version based on user feedback with updated data and methods, a more user-friendly interface, and increased functionality. Colorado EnviroScreen: Identifies areas with current and past environmental inequities. Highlights areas where disproportionately impacted communities have greater environmental health burdens. Identifies geographic areas that meet the cumulative impacts criteria of the disproportionately impacted communities definition under Colorado law (C.R.S. § 24-4-109(2)(b)(II)). Colorado EnviroScreen is intended to: Help users advocate for funding, interventions, and policy changes to avoid, lessen, and mitigate environmental health burdens. Advance a healthy and sustainable Colorado where everyone has the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards.

The dataset depicts the authoritative locations of the most commonly known Department of Defense (DoD) sites, installations, ranges, and training areas world-wide. These sites encompass land which is federally owned or otherwise managed. This dataset was created from source data provided by the four Military Service Component headquarters and was compiled by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) Program within the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment. Only sites reported in the BSR or released in a map supplementing the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) Real Estate Regulation (31 CFR Part 802) were considered for inclusion. This list does not necessarily represent a comprehensive collection of all Department of Defense facilities. For inventory purposes, installations are comprised of sites, where a site is defined as a specific geographic location of federally owned or managed land and is assigned to military installation. DoD installations are commonly referred to as a base, camp, post, station, yard, center, homeport facility for any ship, or other activity under the jurisdiction, custody, control of the DoD.

While every attempt has been made to provide the best available data quality, this data set is intended for use at mapping scales between 1:50,000 and 1:3,000,000. For this reason, boundaries in this data set may not perfectly align with DoD site boundaries depicted in other federal data sources. Maps produced at a scale of 1:50,000 or smaller which otherwise comply with National Map Accuracy Standards, will remain compliant when this data is incorporated. Boundary data is most suitable for larger scale maps; point locations are better suited for mapping scales between 1:250,000 and 1:3,000,000.

The IPCD is a nationwide database of passenger transportation terminals, with data on the availability of connections among the various scheduled public transportation modes at each facility. The IPCD data covers the following types of passenger transportation terminals/stops: 1. Scheduled airline service airports. 2. Intercity bus stations (includes stations served by regular scheduled intercity bus service such as Greyhound, Trailways, code sharing buses such as Amtrak Thruway feeder buses, supplemental buses that provide additional frequencies along rail routes, and airport bus services from locations that are outside of the airport metropolitan area). 3. Intercity and transit ferry terminals. 4. Light-rail transit stations. 5. Heavy-rail transit stations. 6. Passenger-rail stations on the national rail network served by intercity rail and/or commuter rail services. 7. Bike-share stations belonging to bike-share systems that are open to the general public, IT-automated, and station based (contain hubs to which users can grab and return a bike).

water demand over an extended period of time. Droughts can have 
significant environmental, economic, and social consequences. Between 
1980 and the present time, the cost of drought exceeded 100 billion 
dollars, making drought monitoring a key factor in planning, 
preparedness, and mitigation efforts at all levels of government.

For USDM Symbology Style: See USA Drought Intensity - Current Conditions - USDM Color Scheme Online Item! Dataset Summary: This
feature service provides access to current drought 
intensity categories for the entire USA. These data have been produced 
weekly since January 4, 2000 by the U.S. Drought Monitor, see the Full Historical data for the full 
time series. Drought intensity is classified according 
to the deviation of precipitation, stream flow, and soil moisture 
content from historically established norms, in addition to subjective 
observations and reported impacts from more than 350 partners across the 
country. New map data is released every Thursday to reflect the conditions of the previous week. Layer Summary: 'US_Drought_Current': Polygon areas for most recent week This Layer contains a series of drought classification summaries
that fall into two groups: Categorical Percent Area and Cumulative Percent
Area.

Categorical
Percent Area
statistic is the percent of the area in a
certain drought category and excludes areas that are better or worse. For
example, the D0 category is labeled as such and only shows the percent of the
area experiencing abnormally dry conditions.

Cumulative Percent Area statistics combine drought categories for a comprehensive percent of
area in drought. For example, the D0-D4 category shows the percent of the area
that is classified as D0 or worse. Drought Classification Categories are as follows:

Class
Description
Possible Impacts

D0
Abnormally Dry
Going into drought: short-term dryness slows growth of crops/pastures. Coming out of drought: some lingering water deficits; drops/pastures not fully recovered.

D1
Moderate Drought
Some damage to crops/pastures; streams, reservoirs, or wells are low with some water shortages developing or imminent; voluntary water-use restrictions requested.

D2
Severe Drought
Crop/pasture losses are likely; water shortages are common and water retrictions are imposed.

D3
Extreme Drought
Major crop/pasture losses; widespread water shortages or restrictions.

D4
Exceptional Drought
Exceptional and widespread crop/pasture losses; shortages of water in reservoirs, streams, and wells creating water emergencies.
The
U.S. Drought Monitor is produced in partnership between the National 
Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the 
United States Department of Agriculture, and the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration. It is the drought map that the USDA and IRS 
use to define which farms have been affected by drought conditions, 
defining who is eligible for federal relief funds.","climate,drought monitor,drought index,water,climate change,weather,palmer drought index,usda,landscape,earth observations",Current week's data that reveals the extent of drought condition across the United States from the U.S. Drought Monitor.,,"Copyright: © 2024 National Drought Mitigation Center, University of Nebraska-Lincoln",This work is licensed under the Esri Master License Agreement.

The City's Streets Division is responsible for servicing 6,480, lane miles of roadway, extending over a 202 square mile area. While average annual snowfall stands at 42 inches, snow can pile up quickly, at varying rates throughout the City. Elevation and wind can compound accumulation, causing an immediate impact on the City's mobility. Hence, the need for safe and passable streets is a priority for the Streets Division. Street Treatments The City uses three materials on City streets.  The first material is called ""anti-skid"" and is used on most snow routes.  Anti-skid can contain up to 20 percent salt, and is used to aid in vehicle traction.  The second material is used on many of the City's thoroughfares and is called ""IceSlicer.""  This material is a de-icer and will lower the freezing temperature of water.  IceSlicer will work down to around 10 degrees. The third material is “APEX” and is a liquid. It is applied to the roadway before a storm or right as snow begins to fall. It is intended to help stop the bond of snow/ice to the roadway and aids in clean-up after the storms conclusion. For more information please check out the Snow Plow Information site here. Private Property Owner's Responsibility - Parking Lots, Driveways and Sidewalks What is the property owner's responsibility with regard to snow and ice? City maintenance personnel and equipment cannot clear snow on private property. This includes parking lots, driveways and sidewalks for both residences and places of businesses. Residential property owners are responsible for clearing any sidewalks in front of their property within 24 hours of when snow stops falling. The City will initially give written notice to property owners who fail to clear their sidewalks in a timely manner. Ultimately, the Engineering Inspection Division can impose fines for those who do not comply (see City Code Chapter 3, Article 4 - Sidewalks, or click here for more information, including tips to help with sidewalk snow removal). There are no City requirements relating to the condition of private driveways in winter storm situations. However, it is a violation of City ordinance to pile shoveled snow in a street, or on another person's property. The best place to shovel snow is onto your lawn. The City's Service Area 1,609 centerline miles composed of designated major thoroughfares, collector streets and residential streets. 6,480 lane miles (miles of road lanes) 202 square miles Growth/Historical Reference There are a total of 1,609 centerline miles in the City's roadway system. In 1980, there were 800 centerline miles. The City of Colorado Springs has added more miles since 1980 than the entire road system in several Front Range cities, such as Pueblo and Lakewood. State and County Roads All State and County roads are maintained by their own staff.

High (but variable) resolution World Imagery from Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) was also used. Using all available imagery and data, potential fen polygons were hand-drawn based on the best estimation of fen boundaries. Each potential fen polygon was attributed with a confidence value of 1 (low confidence), 3 (possible fen), or 5 (likely fen). In addition to the confidence rating, any justifications of the rating or interesting observations were noted, including iron fens, beaver influence, floating mats, and springs. Once all potential fens were mapped, each polygon was assigned a code for tracking throughout the verification process. The code was a combination of the closest highway segment and a running sequential four-digit number (e.g., 082A-0278).After field verification, additional confidence values of 7 (confirmed fen) and 0 (confirmed non-fen) were added.

However, there are limitations and assumptions that were considered when developing these seed mixtures. Assistance from the environmental staff is strongly recommended before using a seed mixture. Site specific conditions may require adjustment to the seed mixture(s). The seed mixtures contained in this dataset are designed for the site specific conditions (e.g., soil texture and chemical composition, precipitation, elevation, aspect, etc.) associated with the approximate mile marker along Region 2 highways. Native species were selected for the seed mixtures with few exceptions. The individual plant species were selected based on their adaptions to the site conditions, ability to control erosion, and compatibility to establish a diverse plant community. The species composition of the seed mixture was also based on the recommendations found in the Natural Resources Conservation Service’s (NRCS) “Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA).”(http://www.nrcs.usds.gov)

Similarly, the NHDPlus Area and Waterbody feature classes were merged under a single schema. Attribute fields were added to the flowline and waterbody layers to simplify symbology and enhance the layer's pop-ups. Fields added include Pop-up Title, Pop-up Subtitle, On or Off Network (flowlines only), Esri Symbology (waterbodies only), and Feature Code Description. All other attributes are from the original NHDPlus dataset. No data values -9999 and -9998 were converted to Null values for many of the flowline fields. What can you do with this Feature Layer? Feature
layers work throughout the ArcGIS system. Generally your work flow with
feature layers will begin in ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Pro. Below are 
just a few of the things you can do with a feature service in Online and
Pro. ArcGIS Online Add this layer to a map in the map viewer. The layer is limited to scales of approximately 1:1,000,000 or larger but a vector tile layer created from the same data can be used at smaller scales to produce a webmap that displays across the full range of scales. The layer or a map containing it can be used in an application. Change the layer’s transparency and set its visibility range Open
the layer’s attribute table and make selections. Selections made in the map or table are reflected in the other. Center 
on selection allows you to zoom to features selected in the map or table
and show selected records allows you to view the selected records in 
the table. Apply filters. For example you can set a filter to show larger streams and rivers using the mean annual flow attribute or the stream order attribute.
Change
the layer’s style and symbology Add labels and set their properties Customize the pop-up Use as an input to the ArcGIS Online analysis tools. This layer works well as a reference layer with the trace downstream and watershed tools. The buffer tool can be used to draw protective boundaries around streams and the extract data tool can be used to create copies of portions of the data. ArcGIS Pro Add this layer to a 2d or 3d map. Use
as an input to geoprocessing. For example, copy features allows you to 
select then export portions of the data to a new feature class. Change the symbology and the attribute field used to symbolize the data Open table and make interactive selections with the map Modify the pop-ups Apply Definition Queries to create sub-sets of the layer This layer is part of the ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World that
provides an easy way to explore the landscape layers and many other

The estimate for each census tract represents an average that was derived from multiple years of Colorado Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data (2014-2017). CDPHE used a model-based approach to measure the relationship between age, race, gender, poverty, education, location and health conditions or risk behavior indicators and applied this relationship to predict the number of persons' who have the health conditions or risk behavior for each census tract in Colorado. We then applied these probabilities, based on demographic stratification, to the 2013-2017 American Community Survey population estimates and determined the percentage of adults with the health conditions or risk behavior for each census tract in Colorado. The estimates are based on statistical models and are not direct survey estimates. Using the best available data, CDPHE was able to model census tract estimates based on demographic data and background knowledge about the distribution of specific health conditions and risk behaviors. The estimates are displayed in both the map and data table using point estimate values for each census tract and displayed using a Quintile range. The high and low value for each color on the map is calculated based on dividing the total number of census tracts in Colorado (1249) into five groups based on the total range of estimates for all Colorado census tracts.
